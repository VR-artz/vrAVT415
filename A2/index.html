    <h3> ASHA Evaluation</h3>

    <p> While I don't think that this site is bad, it dose have some issues. Most of the errors that the WAVE evaluation reported had to with contrast errors or missing alt image text. The main concern that the evaluation found was the exesive amount of redundent text and links. The site has multiple sections and subcatagories, but what is the point of them all if you are just going to put pretty much the same content in them. I would recomend that this site cut back on all of this content and reorginze itself.</p>
